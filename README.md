# PSS-MachineLearning
Using machine learning models to classify post-synaptic shapes

Each python file creates a visualization of the decision boudaries and confusion matrices for four classifiers (linearSVC, SVM with linear kernel, SVM with RBF kernel, and SVM with polynomial kernel).

The 3Classes file uses only the spine, shaft, and soma classes. The 4 classes file also includes proximal processes. The 8 classes file also includes partial and merged spines and shafts.
